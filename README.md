# Spicy Mexican Chefs Server

This is the server-side code for the Spicy Mexican Chefs website. It provides the backend functionality for the website, including serving the data for chefs and recipes. The server is built with Express.js, uses CORS to enable cross-origin requests, and is deployed on Vercel.

## Built with

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for building the server-side application
- [CORS](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) for enabling cross-origin requests
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment

We used a modern tech stack to build the server-side of Spicy Mexican Chefs, which allowed us to create a scalable and reliable backend for the website. By using Express.js and CORS, we were able to handle requests and responses efficiently and securely. Deploying on Vercel allowed us to easily scale our server as needed and provide a fast and reliable user experience.
